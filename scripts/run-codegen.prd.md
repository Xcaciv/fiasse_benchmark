# run-codegen Script — Product Requirements Document

> Canonical specification for the `run-codegen-*` family of scripts.
> Implementations exist (or should exist) for every `[shell]` × `[llm_cli_tool]` × `[plugin_type]` combination listed below.

---

## 1. Purpose

Automate an LLM-powered CLI tool to generate a complete project from a PRD file in multiple programming languages, each produced in one of the supported variants:

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **rawdog** | Plain generation — no security plugin, no FIASSE constraints. |
| **securable** | Generation with the `[securable_plugin]` active, enforcing FIASSE/SSEM securability attributes. |
| **fiassed** | Generation with the `[securable_plugin]` active plus a PRD enhancement step that applies FIASSE+ASVS guidance before code generation. |

The scripts exist to enable reproducible, side-by-side comparison of plain vs. security-enhanced code generation across languages and LLM CLI tools.

---

## 2. Placeholder Reference

Scripts are parameterised by the following variable dimensions. Implementations replace each placeholder with a concrete value.

| Placeholder | Description | Known Values |
|---|---|---|
| `[llm_cli_tool]` | The LLM CLI executable name | `claude`, `copilot` |
| `[llm_cli_tool_label]` | Human-readable name for status messages | `Claude Code`, `GitHub Copilot CLI` |
| `[shell]` | Script language / shell | `PowerShell`, `bash` |
| `[securable_plugin]` | The security plugin used for "securable" runs | `securable-claude-plugin`, `securable-copilot` |
| `[plugin_repo_url]` | Git clone URL for the plugin | `https://github.com/Xcaciv/securable-claude-plugin.git`, `https://github.com/Xcaciv/securable-copilot.git` |
| `[plugin_temp_dir_name]` | Subfolder name for the cached plugin clone | `_plugin_temp`, `_securable_claude_plugin_temp`, `_securable_copilot_temp` |
| `[default_output_dir]` | Default root output folder | `./codegen-output`, `./copilot-codegen-output` |
| `[output_log_filename]` | Per-variation log file name | `claude-output.log`, `copilot-output.log` |
| `[context_fence_file]` | File placed in rawdog dirs to stop upward context loading | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `[finished_flag_file]` | Sentinel file marking a variation as complete | `.codegen-finished` |

---

## 3. Output Folder Structure

All implementations MUST produce the following directory layout under `[default_output_dir]`:

```
[default_output_dir]/
├── [plugin_temp_dir_name]/    # Cached clone of [securable_plugin] (transient)
├── aspnet/
│   ├── rawdog/                # Plain [llm_cli_tool] generation
│   │   ├── [context_fence_file]
│   │   ├── [output_log_filename]
│   │   ├── [finished_flag_file]
│   │   └── <generated project files...>
│   ├── securable/             # [securable_plugin]-enhanced generation
│       ├── [output_log_filename]
│       ├── [finished_flag_file]
│       └── <generated project files + plugin assets...>
│   └── fiassed/               # securable + PRD enhancement play/workflow
│       ├── [output_log_filename]
│       ├── [finished_flag_file]
│       └── <generated project files + plugin assets...>
├── jsp/
│   ├── rawdog/
│   ├── securable/
│   └── fiassed/
└── node/
    ├── rawdog/
    ├── securable/
    └── fiassed/
```

---

## 4. Parameters / Options

All implementations MUST accept the following parameters. The flag syntax is shell-appropriate (`-PrdFile` / `--prd`, etc.).

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PrdFile` / `--prd` | Yes (except with `Clean`) | — | Path to the PRD markdown or text file to feed to the LLM. |
| `OutputDir` / `--output-dir` | No | `[default_output_dir]` | Root folder for all generated output. |
| `PluginRepo` / `--plugin-repo` | No | `[plugin_repo_url]` | Git URL of the `[securable_plugin]` repository. |
| `DryRun` / `--dry-run` | No | `false` | Print what would run without invoking `[llm_cli_tool]`. Creates stub plugin structures so the full flow can be traced. |
| `Resume` / `--resume` | No | `false` | Preserve existing output directories and skip variations that have a `[finished_flag_file]`. Useful when token limits or rate limits interrupt a run. |
| `Modes` / `--modes` | No | `rawdog,securable` | One or more generation modes to execute. Accepts a list (e.g., `rawdog,securable` or repeated flags). Implementations MUST validate all requested modes and fail early if any mode is unsupported. Error text MUST include the list of available modes. Baseline supported modes are `rawdog` and `securable`; implementations may additionally support `fiassed` when enhancement assets are available for the selected plugin/tool pair. |
| `Clean` / `--clean` | No | `false` | Remove the cached plugin clone (`[plugin_temp_dir_name]`) and all `[finished_flag_file]` flags from the output directory, then exit. No generation is performed. `PrdFile` is NOT required when `Clean` is active. |

### Parameter Interactions

- `Resume` and `Clean` are mutually exclusive with normal generation semantics:
  - `Clean` exits immediately after cleanup — no other work is performed.
  - `Resume` only skips variations where `[finished_flag_file]` exists; all other variations proceed normally (preserving existing content rather than wiping).
- `Modes` accepts one or more values and defaults to the built-in baseline modes (`rawdog`, `securable`).
- If any value in `Modes` is not in the implementation's supported mode list, the script MUST fail before generation starts and print both the invalid values and all available mode options.
- Without `Resume`, existing target directories are **wiped and recreated** before generation.
- Without `Resume`, the `[finished_flag_file]` is **ignored** — completed variations are re-run.

---

## 5. Language Definitions

All implementations MUST use the same set of target languages and labels:

| Key | Label (used in prompts) |
|---|---|
| `aspnet` | ASP.NET Core (C#) Web API / MVC application |
| `jsp` | Java web application using JSP (Java Server Pages) and servlets |
| `node` | Node.js web application using Express.js |

### 5.1 Mode Definitions

Each implementation MUST maintain an explicit supported mode definition map/list and drive execution from that source.

Minimum required built-in modes:

| Mode | Required Behavior |
|---|---|
| `rawdog` | Plain generation with no security plugin constraints. |
| `securable` | Generation with `[securable_plugin]` assets installed and securability constraints applied. |
| `fiassed` | Securable generation plus a pre-generation PRD enhancement operation run after plugin installation and before prompt construction. |

`fiassed` mode requirements:

- For `securable-claude-plugin`, the canonical play is `plays/requirements-analysis/prd-fiasse-asvs-enhancement.md`.
- If the selected plugin/CLI does not use Claude-style plays, implementations MUST run the equivalent enhancement operation using that plugin's native assets/mechanism.
- The enhancement operation MUST be executed appropriately for the active CLI (`claude`, `copilot`, `opencode`, etc.), not by assuming a single tool's command semantics.
- If `fiassed` is requested but the implementation has no usable enhancement mechanism for the selected plugin/CLI combination, it MUST fail early with a clear error.

Future mode additions MUST only require adding a new mode definition and should not require rewriting the core execution loop structure.

---

## 6. Execution Flow

### 6.1 Clean Mode (early exit)

When `Clean` is specified:

1. Resolve `OutputDir` to an absolute path.
2. If `[plugin_temp_dir_name]` exists under `OutputDir`, remove it recursively.
3. Recursively find and delete all `[finished_flag_file]` files under `OutputDir`.
4. Print a summary of what was removed.
5. Exit — no generation is performed.

### 6.2 Normal Mode

#### Step 0 — Initialisation

1. Resolve `PrdFile` and `OutputDir` to absolute paths.
2. Print a status banner showing all parameters.
3. Read the PRD file content into memory once.
4. Create the root `OutputDir` if it does not exist.

#### Step 1 — Prerequisite Check

1. Verify `[llm_cli_tool]` is on PATH (skip in `DryRun` mode).
2. Verify `git` is on PATH (skip in `DryRun` mode).
3. If a required tool is missing, terminate with a clear error message.

#### Step 2 — Clone the Plugin

1. Target directory: `OutputDir/[plugin_temp_dir_name]`.
2. If the directory already exists, skip cloning (print a notice).
3. Otherwise, run `git clone [plugin_repo_url] [plugin_temp_dir_name]`.
4. In `DryRun` mode: create a minimal stub directory structure so later steps can reference plugin files.

#### Step 3 — Generate per Language × Mode

For each language key (`aspnet`, `jsp`, `node`) and each selected mode from `Modes`:

##### 3a. Resume / Skip Check

- If `Resume` is active **and** `[finished_flag_file]` exists in the target directory → skip this variation.
- Otherwise, proceed.

##### 3b. Directory Preparation

- **Without `Resume`**: If the target directory exists, remove it recursively, then recreate it.
- **With `Resume`**: If the target directory exists, keep it as-is.
- Ensure the target directory exists.

##### 3c. Context Isolation (rawdog only)

- Write a minimal `[context_fence_file]` into the rawdog target directory.
- Purpose: prevents `[llm_cli_tool]` from walking up the directory tree and loading plugin files from parent directories.
- Content:
  ```
  # codegen-test: rawdog baseline
  # This file exists only to prevent context from parent directories
  # being loaded into this isolated test run.  Do not add instructions here.
  ```

##### 3d. Plugin Installation (securable and fiassed)

- Copy plugin assets from the cached clone into the target directory.
- Assets vary by `[securable_plugin]`:

  | Plugin | Assets Copied |
  |---|---|
  | `securable-claude-plugin` | `.claude/`, `skills/`, `data/`, `CLAUDE.md` |
  | `securable-copilot` | `.github/` (includes `prompts/`, `agents/`, `copilot-instructions.md`) |

##### 3e. PRD Enhancement (fiassed only)

- After plugin installation and before prompt construction, run a PRD enhancement operation and produce an enhanced PRD.
- For `securable-claude-plugin`, use the play at `plays/requirements-analysis/prd-fiasse-asvs-enhancement.md`.
- For other plugin/CLI combinations, execute an equivalent enhancement workflow using the mechanism appropriate to that CLI/plugin.
- Use the enhanced PRD as `<prd_content>` in the generation prompt.
- In `DryRun`, print what enhancement step would run without executing it.

##### 3f. Prompt Construction

**Rawdog prompt** (all tools):
```
Generate a complete, working [lang_label] project based on the following PRD.

Create all necessary source files, configuration files, and folder structure
inside the current working directory.

Include a README.md with setup and run instructions.
When the project is fully complete, create a file named [finished_flag_file] in the
current working directory. Only create this file after all required project files are done.

PRD:
---
<prd_content>
---
```

**Securable prompt** (plugin-loaded tools):
```
You are operating with the [securable_plugin] active ([context_files] are
present in this directory).

Use the installed plugin files in the working directory as the active source of
securability constraints.

Generate a complete, working [lang_label] project based on the following PRD,
applying the plugin's FIASSE/SSEM constraints throughout all generated code.

Create all necessary source files, configuration files, and folder structure
inside the current working directory.

Include a README.md with:
  - Setup and run instructions
  - A brief SSEM attribute coverage summary describing how each of the nine
    attributes is addressed in the generated code
When the project is fully complete, create a file named [finished_flag_file] in the
current working directory. Only create this file after all required project files are done.

PRD:
---
<prd_content>
---
```

##### 3g. Plugin-Loaded Constraint Handling

For CLIs that automatically load project-local plugin files, the securable prompt
SHOULD rely on the installed plugin assets rather than duplicating plugin content
inline in the prompt.

Implementations MAY still embed workflow content for separate one-off operations
that are not automatically dispatched by the CLI, such as PRD enhancement plays.

##### 3h. Write Permissions Configuration

Before invoking `[llm_cli_tool]`, configure write permissions so the tool can write to the target directory without interactive prompts:

| Tool | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| `claude` | Write `.claude/claude.json` with `allowed_write_directories` pointing to the target dir |
| `copilot` | Write `.claude/claude.json` with `allowed_write_directories` listing all target dirs; pass `--add-dir` on invocation |

##### 3i. LLM CLI Invocation

Invoke `[llm_cli_tool]` non-interactively in the target directory. The tool writes generated files directly into the working directory.

| Tool | Invocation Pattern | Permission Bypass | Prompt Delivery |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude` | `claude --print --permission-mode bypassPermissions` | `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` | Piped via stdin |
| `copilot` | `copilot -p <prompt-file> --allow-all-tools --add-dir <dir> --allow-all-urls --no-alt-screen` | `--allow-all-tools`, `--allow-all-urls` | Written to a temp file, path passed via `-p` |
| `copilot` (variant) | `copilot -p <prompt-file> --allow-tool=write --add-dir <dir> --allow-all-urls --no-alt-screen` | `--allow-tool=write`, `--allow-all-urls` | Written to a temp file, path passed via `-p` |

- All output (stdout + stderr) MUST be captured to `[output_log_filename]` in the target directory via `tee` or equivalent.
- Non-zero exit codes produce a **warning** (not a fatal error) so the loop continues to the next variation.
- Temp prompt files (copilot only) MUST be cleaned up in a finally/trap block.
- When `Resume` is active, pass `--resume` to copilot invocations.

#### Step 4 — Summary

Print a structured summary showing:
1. The generated folder structure with annotations for each variant.
2. Where to find log files.
3. In `DryRun` mode: a clear notice that no LLM calls were made.

---

## 7. DryRun Behaviour

When `DryRun` is active, the script MUST:

- Skip prerequisite tool checks (print a notice instead).
- Create stub plugin directory structures with placeholder files instead of running `git clone`.
- Print each command that **would** run (working directory, prompt preview) without executing it.
- Still exercise the full control flow (directory creation, prompt construction, iteration) so the operator can verify correctness.

---

## 8. Error Handling

- Use strict mode (`Set-StrictMode -Version Latest` / `set -euo pipefail`).
- Stop on errors by default (`$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` / `set -e`).
- LLM CLI non-zero exit codes produce a **warning** and continue to the next variation (do not abort the entire run).
- `git clone` failure is **fatal** — terminate immediately.
- Missing required tools are **fatal** — terminate with a clear message.
